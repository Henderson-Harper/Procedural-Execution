# Procedural Execution

A Roblox project I made for fun. I decided to post it on GitHub because I spent some time making it.
ROJO migration will come once I can figure out how to do it.

### Features
- Over 1 billion procedurally generated maps
- Your standard bomb defusal gameplay

### How I made it
- I started by using the "Laser Tag" template from Roblox Studio
- Other than the gun system, everything else I made myself
## Demo

When I get around to recording it...
