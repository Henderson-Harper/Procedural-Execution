# Procedural Execution

A Roblox project I made for fun. I decided to post it on GitHub because I spent some time making it. 
The game is heavily inspired by CS:GO and Due Process.

### Features
- Over 1 billion procedurally generated maps
- Your standard bomb defusal gameplay

### How I made it
- I started by using the "Laser Tag" template from Roblox Studio
  - A basic team deathmatch with fixed maps, spawns, and weapon
- Other than that system, everything else I made myself
  - Custom loadout system
  - Custom map generation system
  - 10 different weapons
  - 8 different utility items
## Demo
